### Creating a no-JS contact us form

I wanted to create a "Contact us" form for my business web site (https://fhlgroup.co.uk/#contact) but with a strict "NO JS" policy (I'll explain later but TLDR: we've lost the essence of the web in favour of `JS`ifying everything).

Turns out there is a lovely little service https://web3forms.com/ which works for exactly this case.

Neat. Go check it out :-). And feel free to [say hi](https://fhlgroup.co.uk/#contact).
