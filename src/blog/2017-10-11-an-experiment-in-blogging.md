So I am trying a new experiment...

Thanks to [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/) there is now a feasibly blogging platform
that doesn't take me out of emacs.

I am <span class="underline">very</span> bad at blogging. This at least removes a number of barriers
(`markdown`, `non-emacs-editor` etc.).

So, welcome, and let's see where this takes us!
