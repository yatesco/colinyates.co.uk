Preparing for a tech leader position is _hard_. How do you summarise your personality, your passions, your needs, your lessons learnt and abilities honed from decades of experience without writing the next Encyclopaedia Britannica?

You then get a job description: a few pages and a company name. How do you even start to answer the enormous questions "are we a good fit culturally, ethically, technically etc.", "can I offer what they are looking for", "can they offer what I'm looking for", "is this a 6 month, 1 year, 10 year, etc. journey" etc.

Where do you start!?

Well, the good news is that this is a simple problem that we probably face day in/day out: making a safe decision with very limited information and time. The first thing is to get the most out of the information you have:

- review the company's website
- search the company and see if they've been in the news recently. If so, is it good or bad?
- search for "company name glassdoor" and see what employees say
- check the company's financials - are they healthy? Have they sacked a whole bunch of IT people and are now desperately back-pedalling?!

This is good _context_, so summarise. How? Read the material a bunch of times and identify the necessary points, but also recurring themes. What's "behind" what they are asking for? For example, "Tech Lead" can mean any/all of leet hacker, suit wearing 24/7 meetings with stakeholders, help-we-don't-know-what-we-are-doing-so-save-us, Excel and PPT master, budget setter, people manager, IT person etc. Identify the main themes that emerge.

Maybe throw that material into a word cloud. This will highlight repeating _words_ (even if it can't identify the common _theme_ behind the words).

The next step is to repeat the process on **you**. Write the perfect job description you are looking for. How would people review you (ask them!). Be honest. What are **your** needs.

Now compare. Are the matches strong? Are the differences a deal breaker?

As a final step I create a table listing the strong themes/necessary things and write exactly how I meet that need. And back it up with experience if you have it. Then I do it the other way around, i.e., filling in how **they** meet **my** needs.

This ("make a decision now based on hardly any information") is something you will need to do, so get good at it :-).

Ultimately, it's all people. So don't worry. Do your best, put the time in, and have fun. It's hard, time consuming, (and hopefully fun!) for everyone.

P.S> #AI should help a lot here, particularly in summarising, and I'm sure there is a disrupting SaaS waiting to be written, but I still think doing this long hand is worth it.
