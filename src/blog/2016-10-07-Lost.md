Is it me? Am I getting old and grumpy? Well yes, I am, but that might not be cause.

I am watching Lost again, and I am struck again how brilliant it is: the cinematography; the acting; the perfect amount of quirkiness and consistency; the character development and so on.

And yet, whilst I am really appreciating watching it I can't help but feel a sense of loss (see what I did there?) that in a few short months I will have finished the series and there isn't anything I can watch that will match it.

I guess I could watch Serenity again. I could always force my way through BattleStar Galactica....nah, maybe not.

Anyways, gotta go, whats-her-name is about to take out whats-his-face, you know, the one she sat next to in the not-particularly-robust aero-plane :-).
