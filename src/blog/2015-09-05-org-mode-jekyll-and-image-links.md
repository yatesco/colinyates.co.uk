This blog is created by [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) however the
blog posts are written in the excellent
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html) and published to
HTML.

The problem is that the directory structures of the `org` posts doesn't
match the directory structure created by Jekyll. Assume your root
directory looks like:

    _org/
     - posts/
       - 2015-09-05-a-blog-post.org
     - images/
       - an-image.png
    _posts/
    images/
    _site/

> Remember that `_posts/` and `images/` are populated automatically when
> published by org-mode and Jekyll will then populate `_site/`.

In order to include that image in the `org` document you would need to
add a link to `../images/an-image.png`. The org mode publishing system
will copy those images to `/images` however Jekyll will serve the blog
post at `/2015/09/05/a-blog-post/` which contains an (incorrect) link to
`../images/an-image.png`.

# Hack of hacks

The right answer is almost certainly to customise the publishing system
but I am just not that good of an emacs dude (yet!). So, my hack of
hacks is based on the following:

- Jekyll posts are served with a URL that ends in `/`
- `/images/an-image.png` is reachable from `../images/an-image.png` when
  sourced from `/a/`
- Jekyll's [permalink](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) defines the
  URL generation strategy for each post

This means that the 'relativeness' of the images directory and the
published URL directory can be symmetrical if Jekyll serves
`/2015-09-05-a-blog-post/` instead of `/2015/09/05/a-blog-post/`.

To achieve this simply change the `permalink` in your root `_config.yml`
to `/:year-:month-:day-:title` from the default
`/:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title.html`. This means Jekyll will
serve this blog post as a single url. Images are served from `/images`
which is one directory up from _the-blog-url_ that Jekyll is serving
this from so the relative URL `../images/an-image.png` will work.

# Warnings

URLs really shouldn't change that much. _Why_ does Jekyll choose this
strategy? Is it good for SEO? No idea (does anybody really understand
that stuff?). What downsides are there to having the date embedded in
the URL? So this might not be a sensible long-term strategy - I dunno.

# Proof

Everybody loves animals, so here is a photo of one of my dogs and cats
looking very non-plussed:

yourself! Good luck, and by all means create an
